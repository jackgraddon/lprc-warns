## Project Description

I was tasked with restructuring the Learning and Performance Research Center (LPRC)'s Washington Assessment of the Risks and Needs of Students (WARNS) project website using Wordpress. The goal was to create a more user-friendly and visually appealing website that would be easier to navigate and maintain, bringing the old site up to code with new WSU web design standards. I worked with the WARNS team to identify the key features and content that needed to be included on the website, and then designed and developed the site using Wordpress, WSU's web backend platform of choice at the time. The new site is fully responsive and optimized for search engines. The WARNS team is now able to easily update and maintain the site themselves, and the new design has received positive feedback from users.

## Showcase
